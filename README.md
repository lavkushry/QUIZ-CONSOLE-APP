# QUIZ-CONSOLE-APP

Quiz App
The Quiz App is a simple, interactive, and user-friendly application designed to test users' knowledge on various topics. It is developed in Java, leveraging its robustness and cross-platform capabilities.

Features
Multiple Questions: The app supports multiple questions, each with a unique ID and four options for the user to choose from.

User Interaction: The app interacts with the user through the console, presenting questions and options, and taking user input for the answers.

Scalability: The app is designed with scalability in mind. It can easily be extended to support more questions, different types of questions, or more complex scoring algorithms.

Error Handling: The app includes basic error handling, ensuring that it doesn't crash when encountering unexpected inputs or situations.

Usage
The user starts the quiz by running the application. The app then presents a series of questions one by one. For each question, the user is asked to choose the correct option. The user's selections are stored and can be used for scoring or feedback purposes.

Future Enhancements
Future versions of the Quiz App may include features like a graphical user interface, support for different question types (like true/false or fill-in-the-blank), a timer for each question, and the ability to store high scores or track progress over time.
